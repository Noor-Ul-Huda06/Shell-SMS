Great! Here's a README-style **project description** just like the one in your screenshot, but tailored to your version of the **Student Management System in Bash**:



# Student-Management-System-in-Bash

A Linux-based terminal application to manage student academic records, designed with separate portals for **teachers** and **students**. Built using Bash scripting as a semester project for the **Operating Systems** course at FAST University.



## Features

-  **Teacher panel:** Add/edit/delete students, assign marks, calculate grades and CGPA  
-  **Student portal:** View personal grades and CGPA  
-  **Persistent storage:** Uses a text file (`students.txt`) to save and retrieve data  
-  **Reporting:** Generate reports for pass/fail lists, sort students by CGPA  
-  **Backup & Restore:** Easily back up and recover student records  



## Technical Details

- **Language:** Bash  
- **Platform:** Ubuntu Linux  
- **Data Handling:** Text-based flat file (`students.txt`)  
- **Design:** Modular script with functions for each operation  
- **Validation:** Input checks for mark ranges, duplicate roll numbers, and data limits  



## How It Works

- Teachers log in with credentials (`Main` / `1234_5`) to access a full menu  
- Students can log in using their roll number to check their results  
- CGPA and grades are calculated based on marks using defined grading criteria  
- Admin options include sorting, listing pass/fail students, and generating reports  
- Data backup and recovery options help prevent data loss
